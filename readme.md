# CTFD Auto Submitter

This was a quick little script I whipped up for those challenges that always have a _Who Can submit *FLAG* first_ type questions. Typically the flag is given before the CTF starts.


### Note
This is current only set up to use CTFs that are hosted with the CTFD platform. I am sure i can be used else where with a little tweaking.

The default flag is set to 

```
ThisIsaRaceToSeeWhoWins
```
